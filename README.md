## How To run 

### Clone the repo

*Note: Before this, please make sure git and python are installed on you pc

For cloning the GitHub repo Open the Command prompt or terminal of your local pc and copy and paste the below code

  cd ML_Assignment_LR_GD
```

### Dependencies Installation

Install the necessary libraries by copying and pasting the below code into your command prompt or terminal

```bash
  pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib
```
### Run Part 1 Code

Once all the dependencies are installed successfully, we can now run Part 1 of our code. Write the command given below for executing the Part 1 code. Make sure there are different methods for executing a Python file depending on your Python version, environment, OS, and method of installation.

```bash
  py part1.py
    or
  python3 part1.py
    or
  python part1.py
```
*Note: While you are running the Part 1 code after the training is completed, at the end there will be plotting of the graph, for which you need to close one window of the graph to see the next plot.

### Run Part 2 Code

Similar to Part 1, run the Part 2 code by changing the name of the file that we are executing, below is the code for it.

```bash
  py part2.py
    or
  python3 part2.py
